# User Response-Based Fake News Detection on Social Media

This repository contains the codebase and experimental setup for our work on **fake news detection** using **user reactions on social media** posts. This approach is based on our paper titled _"User Response-Based Fake News Detection on Social Media"_, which investigates how usersâ€™ textual comments and emotional reactions can be leveraged to identify misinformation.

##  Abstract

Social media has become a dominant platform for mass communication and information sharing. Its interactive featuresâ€”such as likes, shares, and commentsâ€”allow rapid propagation of content, but also expose users to unverified and potentially misleading information due to the lack of editorial oversight. In this work, we propose a method to detect fake news by analyzing user responses to social media posts. We extract textual features from user comments using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF techniques, and incorporate categorical emotion responses as visual features. Our experimental results, based on models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, show a precision of **0.97**, a recall of **0.99**, and an F1-score of **0.98**, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

## Introduction

### Motivation
The unregulated nature of social media platforms allows misinformation to spread widely and rapidly. Fake news can have severe consequencesâ€”misleading the public, influencing political opinions, or endangering public health.

### Problem Statement
Unlike traditional news media, social media lacks editorial controls and fact-checking processes. This creates a critical need for robust, data-driven methods to detect fake content effectively.

### Our Approach
We present a fake news detection framework that leverages **user reactions**:
- **Textual Comments** â€“ what users write in response to a post.
- **Visual Emotion Responses** â€“ affective cues such as likes, love, anger, etc.

These signals are used to train models that can predict whether a post is **fake** or **real**.

##  Methodology

We explore the effectiveness of **user reaction-based features** in detecting fake news. Our method consists of:

1. **Textual Feature Extraction**:
   - Using a Bag-of-Words model and **TF-IDF vectorization** on user comments.
   
2. **Emotion Feature Representation**:
   - Mapping **categorical emotion responses** (e.g., Like, Love, Sad, Angry) to features reflecting public sentiment.

3. **Classification Models**:
   - Experiments were conducted using multiple classifiers:
     - **Random Forest**
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **XGBoost**
     - Others (for comparison)

##  Dataset: COVIDFake-EmoReact 2021

We use the **Fake-EmoReact 2021** dataset, released as part of the **SocialNLP 2021** shared task (in conjunction with NAACL 2021). This dataset enables analysis of fake news based on how users respond both textually and emotionally.

### Dataset Features

- **Social Media Posts**: Related to COVID-19.
- **User Reactions**:
  - Textual comments.
  - Emotion annotations (e.g., joy, sadness, anger).
- **Labels**: Each post is labeled as **Fake** or **Real**, based on fact-checking.

### Use Cases

- Fake news detection.
- Emotion and sentiment analysis.
- Multi-modal learning (text + emotion).
- Behavioral studies of misinformation.
